PHP Calendar Parser

Can be seen at http://naturalbridgecabinrental.com/cabins/
Click on any cabin. Once the page loads click the Check Availability Cabin. A calendar will populate the available days to rent the cabin.

I also coded the custom Wordpress theme that the entire site runs on. The theme was built on the Boilerplate theme by Aaron T. Grogg.
